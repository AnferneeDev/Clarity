## üéØ About The Project

Clarity is a modern Pomodoro and time-tracking app for Windows that lives in your system tray.

Unlike traditional timers, Clarity helps you understand where your time goes by letting you assign each session to a subject (e.g., Programming, English, Coursework). Over time, you get detailed stats on your focused work.

It‚Äôs lightweight, offline-first, and 100% private.

---

## ‚ú® Core Features

- System Tray Timer: Runs quietly in your system tray and sends Windows notifications when a session is complete.
- Per-Subject Time Tracking: Assign every Pomodoro to a subject and see detailed stats on your work habits.
- To-Do List with Reminders: A simple to-do list for your sessions. You can set a reminder on any task, and Clarity will send a Windows notification.
- Simple Notes Section: A dedicated area to jot down quick notes or ideas during your sessions.
- Customizable Views: Set a custom background image for each view (Pomodoro, Stats, To-Dos, Notes) to personalize your workspace.
- 100% Local & Private: All your data (stats, to-dos, notes) is stored locally on your machine. No servers, no accounts, no worries.
- Unified Timeline View: See a chronological breakdown of your sessions across all subjects in one place.
- Time Filters: Filter your stats by day, week, or custom range to analyze productivity trends.
- No Internet Required: Fully offline-capable. Works without any network connection.
